# Swole
While I was at the gym, I was curious how many pushups I did in 2022.

Now with Swole, guessing is a thing of the past!

My goal for 2023 is to do:
* 10,000 pushups (~27/day)
* 1,000 mins of Abs (~3 mins/day)
* 10,000 squats (~27/day)

... I hope the daily dopeamine injection provided by the confetti cannon is enough to keep me motivated...
